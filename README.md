# TextInTeX
Pronounced: Text in TeX

A mini project library that turns text-based LaTeX and natural notation into copy-pasteable natural looking mathematical text.

I still have to rush some final projects, so I'll start to do this (alongside Shun4MIDI library development) after all that, i.e. around the end of Dec 2025.

I plan to perhaps have libraries in C++ and Python as per usual, and maybe extend this to a Discord bot and to be hosted on a website.
